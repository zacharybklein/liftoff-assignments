## Submission Instructions

### Overview
It's a more secure encrypted web app for keeping your own notes. Users will be able anonymously store notes or create an account. With a login, users can store and organize notes, along with abilities to edit and set storage time lengths. The benefit is with that, with encryption, any note will only be able to be seen by you or someone over your shoulder. We will not store anything that is not unencrypted.
